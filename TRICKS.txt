:: in PATH (should use current directory as a part of path)
export TEST=">"
echo salut $TEST test.txt (should output Salut > test.txt and not redirect)
export POUET=$PATH (echo $POUET should print the PATH)

echo POUET | cat < .gitignore (Should only read from .gitignore and not consider the pipe)
Wildcard should expand to multiple arguments ("test.txt", "pouet.txt") instead of a big single one (which would be "test.txt pouet.txt"), can verify this by doing cd * (should output too many arguments and not file not found)
export TEST="s -la" then execute l$TEST (should do the same as ls -la)
export 123=TEST (not a valid identifier), export _123=TEST valid
sleep 5 | echo test | grep pouet should wait 5 seconds and not return almost intantly
